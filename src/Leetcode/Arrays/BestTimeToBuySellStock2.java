//Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
//
//        Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
//
//        Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
//
//        Example 1:
//
//        Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
//        Output: 7
//        Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
//        Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
//        Example 2:
//
//        Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
//        Output: 4
//        Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
//        Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
//        engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
//        Example 3:
//
//        Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
//        Output: 0
//        Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
